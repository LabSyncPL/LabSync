## 1. Overall Status

-   **Project Status:** Currently in **Phase 1 (Core System / MVP)**.
-   **Architectural Stability:** The core architecture (**Micro-Kernel** + `IAgentModule` interface) is being finalized and implemented.

:::warning Key Risks
-   **Security:** Ensuring the security of remote task execution remains the top priority. This includes robust tokenization, command sanitization, and transport encryption.
-   **Cross-Platform Agent:** Managing the differences between the Windows and Linux environments for consistent agent behavior.
-   **Scalability:** Ensuring the SignalR communication layer can perform efficiently with a large number of concurrent agents.
