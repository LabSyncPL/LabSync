# LabSync Project Roadmap

**Execution Period:** January 2026 – May 2026
**Primary Goal:** To develop a modular RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) system capable of managing a heterogeneous IT environment (Windows/Linux).

---

## 1. Monthly Execution Plan

This plan details the work scheduled for each month of the project.

### January: Architectural Foundation & Security

The goal of the first stage is to create a stable system skeleton and ensure secure communication between all components.

- **Finalize Agent Architecture:** Implement the **Micro-Kernel** pattern and the mechanism for dynamically loading modules (plugins) from external libraries.
- **Agent Registration Workflow:** Implement a device authorization flow that requires administrator approval, blocking access for unverified agents.
- **Network Communication:** Stabilize the transport layer between the agent and server, and configure the containerized environment (Docker) and PostgreSQL database.
- **Code Refactoring:** Organize the project structure, separating business logic from the infrastructure layer.

### February: Remote Access Module (VNC)

This month is dedicated to the most complex system component: the remote desktop implementation.

- **Screen Capture:** Develop an efficient, system-level screen capture mechanism within the agent.
- **Data Transmission:** Implement the dedicated **Data Plane** using raw **WebSockets** for high-performance, low-latency desktop streaming. The **Control Plane** (SignalR) will be used to initiate and manage the connection state.
- **Input Forwarding:** Develop mechanisms to send input device events (mouse, keyboard) from the web interface to the remote system.
- **Optimization:** Implement data compression to reduce network bandwidth consumption.

### March: Task & Automation System

This stage focuses on enabling remote management of the operating system.

- **Job Queuing:** Create a backend system for command distribution (Job Queue) and logic for agents to fetch tasks, including offline support.
- **Script Execution:** Implement the `SoftwareExecutionModule` responsible for running shell commands and automation scripts.
- **Result Handling:** Implement a mechanism for capturing standard output (`stdout`/`stderr`) and sending execution logs back to the administrator's dashboard.
- **Web Console:** Create a UI for interacting with the remote system's shell.

### April: Telemetry & Group Management

Expand the system with analytics and tools for managing multiple workstations simultaneously.

- **Metrics Collection:** Extend the agent with modules (`SystemInfoModule`) to monitor hardware resource usage (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network).
- **Data Storage:** Optimize the database for storing large volumes of time-series telemetry data.
- **Data Visualization:** Implement charts and reports in the admin dashboard to display hardware health over time.
- **Bulk Operations:** Implement logic for grouping devices (e.g., "Computer Lab 101") and executing actions on multiple targets at once.

### May: Stabilization, Testing, and Finalization

The final stage is dedicated to quality assurance and preparing for a production-ready deployment.

- **Load Testing:** Verify system performance with a large number of concurrent agent connections and during video streaming.
- **Security Audit:** Review authentication and authorization mechanisms and secure sensitive configuration data.
- **Documentation:** Prepare technical API documentation, deployment instructions, and end-user guides.
- **UI/UX Finalization:** Polish the user interface, fix bugs, and prepare a final demo version for project defense.

## 2. Project Phases

The following phases define the functional priorities and success criteria for the project's development.

### Phase 1: Core System (MVP)

:::info
**Priority: Critical**

**Goal:** Deliver a stable MVP that fulfills the core requirements for a live demonstration, focusing on the two main pillars: Remote View (VNC) and Script Execution.
:::

- **Functional Scope**:
  - Support for **Windows 10/11** and **Linux** on the Agent side.
  - Real-time, bidirectional communication via **SignalR** for the **Control Plane** (Online/Offline status, commands, logs). The VNC video stream will use a separate, high-performance **WebSocket** channel (**Data Plane**).
  - An execution module (`SoftwareExecutionModule`) to interpret tasks and select the correct engine (PowerShell/Bash/Nix).
  - An application repository that abstracts the OS (e.g., `winget install` for Windows vs. `nix-env` for Linux under a single definition).
- **Expected Outcome**:
  A system that allows an Agent to be run on Windows and Linux, see both as "Online" in the dashboard, establish a VNC connection, and install a test application on both machines simultaneously while receiving logs.

### Phase 2: Management & Automation

:::info
**Priority: High**

**Goal:** Enable scalable management of the entire fleet of devices.
:::

- **Computer Groups**: Logical grouping (e.g., "Lab 101") and bulk operations.
- **Interactive VNC**: Full desktop control (mouse/keyboard input forwarding).
- **Machine Profiles (Desired State)**: Define the target state of an environment and have agents automatically conform to it.
- **Job Queuing**: Handle tasks for offline machines, ensuring execution upon reconnection.

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Extensions

:::info
**Priority: Medium**

**Goal:** Provide enhanced support for helpdesk and analytics.
:::

- **System Telemetry**: Collect metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk) and configure alerts.
- **Hardware Inventory**: Automatically report hardware specifications.
- **Extended Support Tools**: Finalize tools for system operators.

## 3. Security First

:::danger Security is a Core Requirement
Given the system's nature—executing remote commands—security is the highest priority at every stage of development.
:::

- **Tokenization (JWT):** Every Agent uses a unique JWT to authorize its SignalR connection.
- **Encryption (HTTPS/WSS):** All traffic, including commands and video streams, is encrypted in transit.
- **Command Sanitization (No-Eval):** The Agent never interprets an arbitrary string as a script. It only runs predefined system processes with controlled parameters to prevent remote code execution vulnerabilities.
- **Isolation:** The Agent Host runs as a privileged service, but the modular architecture allows for future separation of privileges for individual plugins.
